        <h2>Description: </h2>With thinly sliced beef and tender onions simmered in a savory-sweet sauce, 
            <em>Gyudon</em> or Japanese Beef Rice Bowl is synonymous with comfort. 
            This simple and delicious dish served over hot steamed rice has been a staple in Japanese cuisine 
            for over 150 years. It's a perfect quick meal for a busy weeknight!
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
            <li>1/2 lb thinly sliced beef</li>
            <li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
            <li>Pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga) (to garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock) (use standard Awase Dashi, dashi packet or powder, or Vegan Dashi)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp sake (substitute with dry sherry or Chinese rice wine, or use water for a non-alcohol version)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin (or use 2 Tbsp sake/water + 2 tsp sugar)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sugar (to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the steamed rice, please note that 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked rice, enough for 2 donburi servings (3⅓ cups, 500 g).</li>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. I usually put the thinly sliced beef in the freezer for 10 minutes because it‘s a lot easier to cut semi-frozen meat.</li>
            <li>First, thinly slice ½ onion.</li>
            <li>Next, cut 1 green onions/scallions diagonally into thin slices. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Then, take out ½ lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or ribeye) from the freezer. Cut the semi-frozen sliced meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add ½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock), 2 Tbsp sake, 2 Tbsp mirin, 3 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp sugar. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Next, add the onion slices and spread them throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.</li>
            <li>Then, add the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a lid. Now, turn on the heat to medium and start cooking.</li>
            <li>When the meat has browned, skim off the scum and fat from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer. Turn down the heat to a simmer and continue cooking, covered, for 3–4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. Optional: If you would like to add beaten eggs, you can do it now</li>
            <li>Divide 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice into large donburi bowls. Then, drizzle some of the pan sauce on top of the rice.</li>
            <li>Put the beef and onion mixture on top of the rice. If you’d like, drizzle additional remaining sauce on top. Top the Gyudon with pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga). Enjoy!</li>
